    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Football is my favourite hobby. It's a team sport, in which you can score only by placing the ball inside the goal of the opposite team. Teams content 11 players – field players and a goalkeeper. ... He's the only person that can touch the ball with his hands, but only in his penalty area.Personally I play football for both training and
        fun. Many contacts with the ball improve the
        technique, and moving on the pitch builds the
        condition. Additionaly scoring a goal or
        blocking a dangerous shot is a really nice
        feeling, what makes football a good game for
        minimizing the stress. It’s good to have an onfield idol, that you can watch to improve your
        skills. My idol is Messi’, because I love the way
        he dribbles and passes.While playing, you must remember that
        football is a team game. Individual actions
        may be satisfying, but there’s more pleasure
        from the game when you remember about the
        teamwork. Moreover playing as a team is
        much more effective, and when there’s
        chemistry between the teammates, you can
        beat stronger or even more skilled oponents.</p>
